This project is about me learning how to write HTML and best practices for it.
I will demonstrate that I understand how to set up a standard HTML boilerplate, make headings, paragraphs, make my text bold and italic. Insert text and images in various places, and how to link from either a webpage or directly inside my project.

More will perhaps come.
