        <p>Here is a great recipe for a perfect pork medallion.</p>
        You will be needing the following items to complete this recipe!
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>⅓ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced lemon zest, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers, or to taste</li>

            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the pork medallions in the hot oil until golden-brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Pour in the balsamic vinegar and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pork to a serving platter, then stir the lemon zest and capers into the simmering sauce. Continue simmering until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.</li>
